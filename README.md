### Introduction

------------------------------------------

**SSRS** is a generic role-playing system that can be used in any conceivable setting with minimal modification.

Why a another RPG system you ask? Because we wanted a simple system that was linear and generic without too much fluff. Systems that use stat challenges based on a curve may be more realistic but they also get more complex. After all, we want to play a game where events are extraordinary, not the mundane outcomes reality gives us. We want spectacular triumphs and dismal hysterical failures relatively often. The main goals of the system was for it to be generic enough to encompass any setting, *(Unless the Game Master wants the players to be intelligent shades of blue that attack using amoeba vacuole digestive processes. That may take some modification.)* and for a new novice player to learn the rules in less than 5 minutes. We also wanted the player to have all the knowledge they needed to play available on one character sheet and the GM to only need a couple of outcome charts, if any.

Unlike a lot of other systems, we do not coddle the Game Master (GM) with a stat reference for every possible inevitability. The GM is responsible for creating a world for the players and for letting them enjoy that world. The GM, as storyteller, drives the drama and adventure. We think the GM can be trusted to make a judgement on how difficult it should be for the player to brew a nice cup of alien tea *(a DC of 16 using your xeno-brewing skill BTW)*.

Even though percentile dice (2D10 / D100) are used , SSRS is not a percentile based system. Really, any type of dice could be used with minimal change to the rules, but two ten sided dice (2D10) provide many possibilities. With percentile dice you generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100. We will refer to the percentile dice as (D100) for the rest of the rules. 

None of the rules are set in stone. We ask that the Game Master add what the game needs, and by all means throw away those rules they do not like. House rules make any system fit a dynamic group. Crunchy players (those who love stats and hardcore rules) may want more charts to reference and granularity on what they can attempt. Novice players and the relaxed gamer may what to drop rules that slow down the game or require extra calculation.

### Skill Challenges

--------------------------------

Skills are roll-over based.

In a roll-over system you roll D100, add your skill modifiers, and beat a target number (also known as the target's Difficulty Class or DC).

**Example:** Lets say the player wants to climb a 12 foot wall. The GM tells them that the difficulty is a DC of 45 because the wall lacks conventional hand holds. The player has a climb skill of 15. To successfully scale the wall the player would have to roll the percentile dice (D100) and then add their +15 climb skill. The total needs to be 45; the difficulty of the wall, or higher. If the player rolls a 33 and adds their +15 climb skill, the result is 48. 48 is higher than the DC of 45 for the wall so they successfully climb over the obstacle.

### Critical Successes and Failures

--------------------------------

On any skill roll you can succeed or fail. You can also succeed masterfully *(like a ninja)* or be an extremely dismal failure *(you decapitate yourself)*.

A critical success or failure is achieved by rolling very high or very low. Without any skill modifiers added (a "Natural" roll), it is a roll of 1 through 5 for a critical failure or a roll of 96 through 100 for a critical success. Of course these numbers might be different depending on your house rules.

**• Critical Success •**

Critical successes will have different outcomes depending on the skill in question. (Of course the outcome can be created by the GM as needed to make the game more entertaining.)

In an attacking scenario a critical success results in double damage. If the roll was a perfect 100 (0/0 on percentile dice) the target is hit with the equivalent of 100% of its starting (non modified) hit points. Thus a target with a magical armour enhancement of +15 hit points might survive a perfect 100 hit with only the magical 15 hit points left.

**• Critical Failures •**

Critical failures will also have different outcomes depending on the skill. (This is where a GM can make some really spectacular failures if desired.)

In an attacking scenario a critical failure might make the weapon unusable for 1D6 turns. This is because it has overheated, was thrown during the battle, jammed, or whatever creative reason the GM comes up with or rolls on a chart. If the roll was a pitiful 1 (0/1 on percentile dice) the player is hit with the equivalent damage of the weapon being used, or the weapon is unusable until it can be professionally serviced. The GM may use a chart with different failures that can be rolled for if they desire.

**• Example Combat Failure Chart •**

- D100 of 2 3 4 5	= Weapon unusable for 1D6 turns
- D100 of 1		= Roll 1D6 and consult chart below
	- D6 Roll of 1 = Weapon is damaged and unusable until serviced
	- D6 Roll of 2 = Weapon is permanently destroyed or lost
	- D6 Roll of 3 = Player is hit with maximum damage of the weapon used
	- D6 Roll of 4 = Target takes weapon from player
	- D6 Roll of 5 = Weapon is knocked from the players hands
	- D6 Roll of 6 = Weapon jams and is unusable for the rest of the combat encounter
