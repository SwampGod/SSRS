## SSRS /s√ªrs/  

------------------------------------------

This is a collection of roll charts and lists to use with SSRS. The current selection is mostly for modern gear and weapons because my current campaign is a cold war era game with supernatural spooky stuff happening. I am also creating a Foundry VTT system for it so the charts are probably mostly in JSON. I'll try to provide them in human readable formats too.
